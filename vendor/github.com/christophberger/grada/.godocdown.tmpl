# Grada - A DIY dashboard based on Grafana

Create a DIY dashboard for all metrics generated by your code, using a Grafana dashboard as a frontend.

Whenever you have code that generates time series data (for example, the current CPU load, number of network connections, number of goroutines,...), you can feed this data to a Grafana panel with only a few lines of code.

"Time series data" in this context is nothing more but a floating-point value and a timestamp.
